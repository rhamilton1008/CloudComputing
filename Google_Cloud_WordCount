1. Git Hadoop Sandbox docker files

```
git clone https://github.com/hadoop-sandbox/hadoop-sandbox.git
cd hadoop-sandbox
```
2. Bring up the Hadoop Cluster

```
docker compose up -d
```
the -d flag makes it so that we can't use the command prompt until everything is online

we then call "docker ps" to make sure all of our images are healthy

3. SSH into the cluster. The allows us to work as the "sandbox" user. the PW is sandbox

```
ssh -p 2222 sandbox@localhost
```

4. Verify "mapred" command by running the following

```
mapred streaming --help
```

5. Make book directory Curl in the same books as last time

```
mkdir books
curl https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1342/pg1342.txt -o books/austen.txt
curl https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/84/pg84.txt -o books/shelley.txt
curl https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/768/pg768.txt -o books/bronte.txt
```
